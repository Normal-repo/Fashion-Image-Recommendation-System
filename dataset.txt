Description:
- 44k fashion product images
- High-resolution product photos
- Metadata provided in styles.csv and styles.json
- Each product has a unique ID (e.g., 42431)
- Multiple labels: category, subcategory, gender, etc.

Usage:
1. Local Machine
   Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above, extract it, and place the
   images and metadata files in your local project directory before running
   the notebook.

2. Running on Kaggle Notebook
   If you run the project inside a Kaggle Notebook:
   - You do NOT need to download the dataset manually.
   - Simply add the dataset as an "Input" to your Kaggle Notebook.
   - Kaggle will automatically mount it at: /kaggle/input/fashion-product-images-dataset/

This avoids download time and allows direct access to:
- /kaggle/input/fashion-product-images-dataset/images/
- /kaggle/input/fashion-product-images-dataset/styles.csv
